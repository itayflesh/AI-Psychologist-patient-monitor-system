# Patient AI - Monitor System for Psychologists 

## Description
The Patient Monitor System is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to enhance psychological therapy sessions through advanced analytics and natural language processing. This system transforms traditional therapy session recordings into actionable insights, helping psychologists better understand patient progress and emotional patterns.

### Key Features
-  Automated transcription of therapy sessions with speaker identification
-  Real-time sentiment analysis of patient and therapist interactions
-  Detection and visualization of emotional changes during sessions
-  Semantic search capabilities across all session transcripts
-  Automated topic identification and tracking
-  Structured database storage for easy data retrieval and analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Psychologist-patient-monitor-system.git
cd patient-monitor-system
```

2. Set up API keys:
- Create an account at [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com)
- Add your API keys to the respective fields in `Project.py`:
```python
aai.settings.api_key = "your_assemblyai_api_key"
client = OpenAI(api_key = "your_openai_api_key")
```

## How It Works

1. **Speech-to-Text Processing**
   - Audio recordings are processed using AssemblyAI's API
   - Advanced speaker diarization separates patient and therapist voices
   - Timestamps and speaker labels are preserved for accurate analysis

2. **Sentiment Analysis & Topic Detection**
   - Each utterance is analyzed using OpenAI's GPT-3.5
   - Sentiment scores are assigned on a scale from -10 to 10
   - Significant emotional changes are automatically detected
   - Key discussion topics are identified and categorized

3. **Semantic Search**
   - Vector embeddings are generated for each sentence
   - Cosine similarity is used for context-aware searching
   - Search results include surrounding conversation context

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Interactive sentiment graphs show emotional patterns
   - Topic tracking across multiple sessions
   - Easy-to-read transcripts with speaker identification

## Running the Project

1. Initialize the database:
```bash
python database_handler.py
```

2. Launch the Streamlit interface:
```bash
streamlit run webpage_handler.py
```

3. Using the interface:
   - Add new patients through the sidebar
   - Upload session recordings in WAV, MP3, or MP4 format
   - View transcripts and analysis in real-time
   - Search across sessions using natural language queries
   - Track emotional patterns and significant changes
